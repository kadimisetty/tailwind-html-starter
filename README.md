# tailwind-html-starter

This is a basic starter template to let one get going with tailwind immediately.

1. Read `package.json` to see dependencies.
2. Read `tailwind.config.js` to check tailwind configuration.
3. On first run, run `npm install` to setup dependencies etc.
4. Open workspace with `tmuxinator start ./.tmuxinator.yml` which opens the
   relevant `npm run` commands in the `SERVER` pane and opens with the editor
   in the `EDITOR` pane. Since there is no `Session.vim` on first run, expect
   that error. Here on, continue editing `index.html` while viewing the
   live-reload version of the website that was automatically opened with
   `live-server`.
5. Customize according to needs.
