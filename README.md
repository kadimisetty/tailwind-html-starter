# tailwind-html-starter

# Initial one-time setup
1. Read `package.json` to see dependencies.
2. Read `tailwind.config.js` to check tailwind configuration.
3. On first run, run `npm install` to setup dependencies etc.
4. Open workspace with `tmuxinator start ./.tmuxinator.yml`. Since there is no `Session.vim` on first run, expect that error. Here on, continue editing `index.html` while viewing the live-reload version of the website that was automatically opened with `live-server`.
5. Customize according to needs.
